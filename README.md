#Project Title- Cryptocurrency Forecasting
This project presents a hybrid deep learning system for Bitcoin price forecasting using high-frequency minute-level BTC/USDT data. The pipeline begins with loading and preprocessing the raw dataset, including timestamp conversion, chronological sorting, handling missing values, and engineering essential time-based features such as hour, weekday, and month to capture market behavior. Core OHLC values are scaled for stability, and a dedicated LSTM encoder is trained on sliding windows of past price data to generate compact embedding vectors that summarize short-term market dynamics. These embeddings are merged with scaled OHLC and temporal features to form a rich hybrid feature matrix. The forecasting model integrates components inspired by the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) architecture, including a Variable Selection Network for dynamic feature weighting, Gated Residual Networks for nonlinear transformations, an LSTM encoder for sequential structure, and Multi-Head Attention to capture long-range dependencies. Instead of predicting raw prices directly, the model forecasts relative returns, which improves learning stability and allows accurate conversion back into price predictions. The overall system is trained using GPU acceleration with early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and a structured 80/10/10 train-validation-test split. Performance is evaluated using RMSE for price error and Directional Accuracy for trend prediction. The project demonstrates a complete, scalable pipeline for large-scale financial time-series forecasting by combining sequential deep learning, attention mechanisms, and learned temporal embeddings.
